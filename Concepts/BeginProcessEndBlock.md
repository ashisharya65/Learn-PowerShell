# Begin, Process, and End Blocks in PowerShell

In PowerShell, advanced functions (also known as script cmdlets) can have three distinct blocks: `Begin`, `Process`, and `End`. These blocks allow you to control how the function processes input from the pipeline.

## Begin Block

The `Begin` block is used to initialize any variables or state that your function needs. It runs once before any pipeline input is processed.

### Example of Begin Block

```powershell
function Initialize-Example {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param ()
    
    begin {
        Write-Output "Begin block: Initializing..."
        $global:sum = 0
    }
    
    process {
        Write-Output "This is the process block"
    }
    
    end {
        Write-Output "This is the end block"
    }
}

# Usage example
Initialize-Example
```

In this example, the `Begin` block initializes a global variable `$sum` to zero. This block runs once before any items are processed.

## Process Block

The `Process` block contains the main processing logic. It runs once for each item in the pipeline.

### Example of Process Block

```powershell
function Process-Example {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline = $true)]
        [int]$Number
    )
    
    begin {
        Write-Output "Begin block: Initializing..."
    }
    
    process {
        Write-Output "Process block: Processing $Number"
    }
    
    end {
        Write-Output "End block: Finalizing..."
    }
}

# Usage example
1..5 | Process-Example
```

In this example, the `Process` block is executed for each number in the input (1 through 5). It processes each number individually.

## End Block

The `End` block runs once after all pipeline input has been processed. It is typically used to clean up or output the final result.

### Example of End Block

```powershell
function Finalize-Example {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param ()
    
    begin {
        Write-Output "Begin block: Initializing..."
        $global:sum = 0
    }
    
    process {
        Write-Output "Process block: Processing..."
        $global:sum += 1
    }
    
    end {
        Write-Output "End block: Finalizing..."
        Write-Output "Total count is $global:sum"
    }
}

# Usage example
1..5 | Finalize-Example
```

In this example, the `End` block outputs the final value of `$sum`.

## Full Example

Here is a complete function with `Begin`, `Process`, and `End` blocks:

```powershell
function Get-Example {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline = $true)]
        [int]$Number
    )
    
    begin {
        Write-Output "Begin block: Initializing..."
        $sum = 0
    }
    
    process {
        Write-Output "Process block: Processing $Number"
        $sum += $Number
    }
    
    end {
        Write-Output "End block: Finalizing..."
        Write-Output "The sum is $sum"
    }
}

# Usage example
1..5 | Get-Example
```

## Explanation

1. **Begin Block**: Initializes the `$sum` variable. This block is executed once before processing any pipeline input.
2. **Process Block**: Processes each item in the pipeline, adding each `$Number` to the `$sum`. This block is executed once for each item in the pipeline.
3. **End Block**: Outputs the final value of `$sum`. This block is executed once after all pipeline input has been processed.

By using the `Begin`, `Process`, and `End` blocks, you can create functions that handle pipeline input efficiently and perform initialization and cleanup tasks as needed.

## Another Example

Here's another example to demonstrate these blocks:

```powershell
function Get-UpperCase {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline = $true)]
        [string]$Text
    )
    
    begin {
        Write-Output "Begin block: Preparing to convert text to uppercase..."
    }
    
    process {
        Write-Output "Process block: Converting '$Text' to uppercase"
        $upperText = $Text.ToUpper()
        Write-Output $upperText
    }
    
    end {
        Write-Output "End block: Conversion complete."
    }
}

# Usage example
"hello", "world" | Get-UpperCase
```

In this example:
- The `Begin` block outputs a message before processing starts.
- The `Process` block converts each input string to uppercase.
- The `End` block outputs a message after all input has been processed.

Using these blocks helps structure your function to handle initialization, processing, and finalization tasks clearly and effectively.
